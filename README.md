# Overview
This is a mod for [Himeko Sutori](https://himekosutori.com/) that lets you do searches in the lance management screen (ie. the squad menu) via the command line. Characters that don't match your search are filtered and greyed out.

Search works against the following: character names, class names (the character's current one), any learned reactions, and any learned passive abilities (eg. Slimologist).

Find Mod depends on another Himeko Sutori mod, [Events Mod](https://github.com/solimodsthings/EventsMod).
